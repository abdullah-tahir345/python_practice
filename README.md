# python_practice

I have learned a lot of things in these projects. I have learned about these functions/terms.
  <br>--Lists
  <br>--Lists Methods (append, extend, insert, index, clear, copy, remove, pop)
  <br>--Dictionaries
  <br>--Classes
  <br>--Objects/Instance
  <br>--Attributes/Variables
  <br>--Access Specifiers/Access Modifiers (Public, Private, Protected)
  <br>--Formal and Actual Arguments/Parameters
  <br>--Constructor
  <br>--Class OR Static Variables
  <br>--Instance Variables

Some detailed description about my projects. Either I didn't use comments in some of my codes.
 <br>-- Use of Lowercase Titles: Using lowercase titles and checking availability in a case-insensitive manner is a good approach to ensure robust functionality.
 <br>-- Informative Messages: Your code provides clear and informative messages for each operation, making it easy to understand the outcomes.
 <br>-- Error Handling: You've implemented error handling for checking out and returning books, which is an important aspect of the code.
 <br>-- Efficient Use of Data Structures: Using dictionaries to represent books allows for efficient look-up and storage of book information.
 <br>-- Demonstrated Operations: You've thoroughly demonstrated various library operations, which is a good practice to show that the class works as intended.
